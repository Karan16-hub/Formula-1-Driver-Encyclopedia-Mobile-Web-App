This is a mobile app I built using React Native and Expo Snack as part of a course project. It works like a mini F1 encyclopedia â€” showing driver names, images, and details in a scrollable, responsive layout. I used components, props, and state to organize the UI and manage data, and added some basic styling for a clean look. Built and tested entirely in Expo Snack.
